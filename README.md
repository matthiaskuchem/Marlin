# Stock configuration branch

The branch `skre3turbo_stockConfig` is the base for my personal printer configuration in the branch `skre3turbo`. It has just one commit off the Marlin Firmare with the latest supplied example configuration from [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/import-2.1.x/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3%20V2/BigTreeTech%20SKR%20E3%20Turbo/MarlinUI) applied for my Creality Ender 3v2 with BigTreeTechs SKR E3 Turbo.

__Do not use this branch__! Everytime I update, I do recreate this branch based off the MarlinFirmware and apply the latest example configuration.
