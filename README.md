# Fork for Creality Ender 3v2 with BTT SKR E3 Turbo

The branch `skre3turbo` contains the configuration for my personal printer. It is based on the example configuration for the Creality Ender 3v2 with BigTreeTechs SKR E3 Turbo provided in [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/import-2.1.x/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3%20V2/BigTreeTech%20SKR%20E3%20Turbo/MarlinUI) on the branch `skre3turbo_stockConfig`.

__Do not use this branch__! Everytime I update, I do recreate / rebase this branch and the `skre3turbo_stockConfig` branch based off the MarlinFirmware.

## My setup

I do use a modified Creality Ender 3v2 with BigTreeTech SKR E3 Turbo motherboard. The stock display works with a custom cable (described in the Marlin Configuration example for this configuration). I also added some LED lights and a BLTouch sensor.
